Introduction
If you have ever picked up a programming manual and felt your forehead go
clammy and your eyes cross as you attempt to make sense of the longwinded explanations, this is the guide for you.
I have been in your position, attempting to learn how to program and having to rely on the
traditional style of guides. I know from painful experience how quickly I glaze over and my
brain solidifies; after only a few pages the tedium leaves me blindly reading words without
any real notion of what they mean any more. Inevitably I give up and the whole process
makes me feel like a limp failure, gasping for breath after I surface from drowning in
technical jargon.
I hated having to read through pointless drivel and then be presented with a short program
telling me exactly what to type in and then spend the next 20 pages reading about what I
have just done and the 101 ways I could run it. I hated having no control
over trying things out for myself and I hated the way these guides would
only contain one or two challenges at the end of a chapter of theory.
I knew there had to be a better way, and thankfully there is. I wrote it and
you are presently reading it, so aren’t you lucky? This guide is refreshingly
different and helps you learn how to program with Python by using practical examples
rather than self-important explanations.
Many programmers learn through
experimentation, looking at others’ code and
working out what method is best for a given
situation. This book is a hands-on approach to
learning programming. After minimal reading
you are set a number of challenges to create the
programs. You can explore and experiment with
the programming language and look at the
example solutions to learn how to think like a
programmer. There are no chapters entitled
“the architecture of a computer”, “the theory of
programming” or any other gobbledy-gook
other authors like to waste time with. I don’t
want to baffle you with theory or blind you with
overbearing explanations that suck out your
enthusiasm for learning to program.

2

Introduction

Hopefully, you want to get stuck into creating programs, solving problems and enjoying the
sense of accomplishment that you get as you proudly look over your lines of code, knowing
that you created something that works. That is great, your eagerness is to be applauded
and I salute those who are reading this while already sitting at their computers, fingers
poised and ready to get going. If that is the case, that you already have Python open on your
screen and are itching to get going, then away you go and I’ll see you in the first chapter
called “The Basics” on page 11.
For everyone who is still with us and is feeling a little more timid, there are just a few more
things to tell you about before you take the plunge.

How to Use This Book
This book builds from very simple programs to more complex ones. If you are new to
programming or new to Python, start with “The Basics” and work through the chapters in
order.
If you are familiar with Python programming and feel confident with the
basics, the theory and logic surrounding programming, then you can just dip
in and out of the book to get help on the specifics you need.
The book is split into two sections:

Part I
In Part I, each chapter takes you through some basic programming rules and challenges for
you to complete and includes:
x a simple explanation giving you pointers, which is useful if you are new to
programming in Python;
x examples of code with a short explanation, which you can use as a basis to solve the
challenges;
x a list of challenges for you to work through that get harder as you move through them.
Each challenge should only take between a couple of minutes and 20 minutes to solve;
however, some of the more complex challenges near the end of Part I will take longer
as you build up the techniques you will be using. Don’t panic if you take longer than
this, as long as you solve the problems without too much copying from the suggested
solution, you are doing fine;
x code containing a possible solution for each challenge; there is often more than one
answer available, but we include just a single program as a possible solution that you
can refer to if you get stuck on a particular aspect of the code.

Introduction

Part II
In Part II, you are given some larger challenges which utilize the programming skills you
learnt in Part I and allow you to consolidate and reinforce the techniques you have been
practising. In this section, you are not given the help and example code that is given in Part
I and it will take longer to solve each challenge. After each challenge, you are given one
possible answer that you may find useful if you are stuck. However, you may have found
another solution that works just as well.

Who Is This Book
For?
This book is suitable for anyone who wants to learn how
to program with Python. It is an essential tool for
teachers and students in Key Stage 3 or those studying
computer science who need help and ready-made
examples to practise programming techniques and
build confidence. It can also be used to help with a
computer science programming project resource bank,
to help pupils needing additional support or just a quick
reminder of the syntax when creating programs.

Downloading Python

Downloading Python
You can download Python for free from the official Python website:

www.python.org/downloads/

Click on the latest version (in the example above, click on the Download Python 3.6.2 button)
to start the installation.
The program will download an executable (.exe) file. When you run this program, you will
see an install window like the one shown below.

Click the Install Now option and the program will start installing Python onto your system.

Downloading Python

Running Python
To start Python on a Windows system, click on the Windows icon or Start menu and select
the IDLE (Python version number) option as highlighted below.

Some Tips

Some Tips
File Location
On a Windows system, the Python folder is usually found in the C:\ drive and will be named
Python36 (or similar) and the files will automatically be saved in the same location, unless
you save them specifically in another location.

Using Comments
Comments are a very useful tool for programmers. They serve two purposes:
x adding an explanation of how the program works;
x stopping parts of the program from working temporarily so you can run
and test other parts of the program.
The first, and original, purpose of explaining how a program works is so other programmers
can make sense of your programs in case your code needs to be altered and updated in the
future and to remind you about why you wrote particular lines of code.

In this example, comments have been added at the end of the last three lines. They are
shown in red and start with the # symbol.
In reality, you would not add comments on lines which contain obvious code as it would
clutter the screen; you would only add comments where necessary.
As Python knows to ignore anything after a # symbol, programmers soon started to use # at
the start of lines of their code to block out sections they do not want to run so they can focus
on and test others.

Some Tips

7

In this example, the # has been added to the first line of the program to
temporarily stop it from running. To bring it back into the running order
simply delete the # and the code will be reactivated.
In this guide, we have not included any comments to the programs so you have to read the
code to make sense of it. That way you will really learn how to code! If you are creating
programs as part of your coursework you should add comments to explain your
programming to the examiner.

Formatting Python
In most versions of Python IDLE it is possible to quickly add comments and indent code
using the menus. This way, if you need to block out entire areas using a comment you
simply highlight the lines and then select the Format menu and select Comment Out
Region. Similarly, if you need to indent a region (we will look at the reason for indenting
code later) then you can also easily do this with the menu.

Okay, that is all the “housekeeping” out of the way. No more procrastinating; take a deep
breath and away we go…

Challenges 1 - 11

The Basics
Explanation
This is the shell window and is the first screen you see when you launch Python.

It is possible to write Python code straight into the shell, but as soon as
you hit [Return] at the end of a line, it will run that line of code. This may
be suitable for using Python as a quick calculator; for instance, you can
type in 3*5 at the prompt and Python will show the answer 15 on the
next line; however, this style of inputting is not useful for more complex
programs.
It is much better to start a new window, create all the code in the new window,
save your code and run it.
To create a new window in which to write your code, select File and New.
Once you enter your code in this new window you can save it and run it all in one
go. This will then run the code in the shell window.
Alternatively, Python programs can be written using
any text editor and must be saved with the file name
extension .py in order to work. These programs can
then be run from the command prompt by typing in the
full directory root and file name.

12

Challenges 1 - 11: The Basics

Running Your Program
Every time you run the code your program will need to be saved afresh in case there have
been any changes to it.
In this version of Python, you can run the program by selecting the Run menu and
selecting Run Module. Alternatively, you can press the [F5] key. If this is the first time
the program is saved, Python will prompt you to name and save the file before it will allow
the program to run.

Important Things to Note
When Writing Your
Programs
Python is case sensitive so it is important that you use the correct case, otherwise
your code will not work.
Text values need to appear in speech marks (") but numbers do
not.
When naming variables (i.e. values that you want to store
data in) you cannot use any dedicated words such as print,
input, etc. otherwise your code will not work.
When saving your files do not save them with any
dedicated words that Python already uses, such as print,
input, etc. If you do this it will not run and you will need to
rename the file before it works.
To edit a program you have saved and closed, right-click on the
file and select Edit with IDLE. If you just double-click on
the file it will only try to run it and you will not be able to edit it.

Challenges 1 - 11: The Basics

13

Example Code
num1 = 93

answer = num1 + num2

Set the value of a variable, if
there is not a variable already
created, it will create one. A
variable is a container for a value
(in this case the variable will be
called “num1” and store the value
93). The value stored in the variable
can change while the program is
running. The variable can be called
whatever you want (except Python
dedicated words such as print,
save, etc.) and it must start with a
letter rather than a number or
symbol and have no spaces.

Adds together num1 and num2 and stores the
answer in a variable called answer.

answer = num1 - num2
Subtracts num2 from num1 and stores the
answer in a variable called answer.

answer = num1 * num2
Multiplies num1 by num2 and stores the
answer in a variable called answer.

answer = num1 / num2
Divides num1 by num2 and stores the answer
in a variable called answer.

answer = num1 // num2
A whole number division (i.e. 9//4 = 2) and
stores the answer in a variable called answer.

print (“This is a message”)
Displays the message in the brackets. As the value we want displayed is a text value it
has the speech marks, which will not be displayed in the output. If you wanted to display
a numerical value or the contents of a variable, the speech marks are not needed.

print (“First line\nSecond line”)
“\n” is used as a line break.

print (“The answer is”, answer)
Displays the text “The answer is” and the value of the variable answer.

textValue = input(“Enter a text value: ”)
Displays the question “Enter a text value: ” and stores the value the user enters in a
variable called textValue. The space after the colon allows a space to be added before
the user enters their answer, otherwise they appear squashed unattractively together.

numValue = int(input(“Enter a number: ”))
Displays the question “Enter a number: ” and stores the value as an
integer (a whole number) in a variable called numValue Integers can be
used in calculations but variables stored as text cannot.

If Statements
Explanation
If statements allow your program to make a decision and change the route that is
taken through the program.

Below is how the if statement for this flow chart would look in Python.

18

Challenges 12 - 19: If Statements

Indenting Lines of Code
Indenting is very important in Python as it shows the lines that are dependent on others, as
shown in the example on the previous page. In order to indent text you can use your [Tab]
key or you can press your [space key] five times. The [backspace] key will remove
indents.
The first line of the if statement tests a condition, and if that condition is met (i.e. the first
condition is true) then the lines of code directly below it are run. If it is not met (i.e. the first
condition is false) it will test the second condition, if there is one, and so on. Below are
examples of the different comparison and logical operators you can use in the condition
line of your if statement.

Example Code
Please note: In the examples
shown, num is a variable
entered by the user that has
been stored as an integer.

if num > 10:
print(“This is over 10”)
else:
print(“This is not over 10”)
If num1 is over 10, it will display the message “This is
over 10”, otherwise it will display the message “This is
under 10”.

if num > 10:
print(“This is over 10”)
elif num == 10:
print(“This is equal to 10”)
else:
print(“This is under 10”)
If num1 is over 10, it will display the message “This is
over 10”, otherwise it will check the next condition. If
num1 is equal to 10, it will display the message “This is
equal to 10”. Otherwise, if neither of the first two
conditions have been met, it will display the message
“This is under 10”.

if num >= 10:
if num <= 20:
print(“This is between 10 and 20”)
else:
print(“This is over 20”)
else:
print(“This is under 10”)
If num1 is 10 or more then it will test another if statement to see if num1 is less than or
equal to 20. If it is, it will display the message “This is between 10 and 20”. If num1 is not
less than or equal to 20 then it will display the message “This is over 20”. If num1 is not
over 10, it will display the message “This is under 10”.

text = str.lower(text)
Changes the text to lower case. As Python is case sensitive, this
changes the data input by the user into lower case so it is easier to
check.

20

Challenges 12 - 19: If Statements

num = int(input(“Enter a number between 10 and 20: ”))
if num >= 10 and num <= 20:
print(“Thank you”)
else:
print(“Out of range”)
This uses and to test multiple conditions in the if statement. Both the conditions must
be met to produce the output “Thank you”.

num = int(input(“Enter an EVEN number between 1 and 5: ”))
if num == 2 or num == 4:
print(“Thank you”)
else:
print(“Incorrect”)
This uses or to test the conditions in the if statement. Just one condition must be met
to display the output “Thank you”.

Ask for two numbers. If
the first one is larger
than the second, display
the second number first
and then the first
number, otherwise show
the first number first and
then the second.

Ask the user to enter a
number that is under
20. If they enter a
number that is 20 or
more, display the
message “Too high”,
otherwise display
“Thank you”.

Ask the user to enter a
number between 10 and 20
(inclusive). If they enter a
number within this range,
display the message “Thank
you”, otherwise display the
message “Incorrect

015
Ask the user to enter their favourite colour. If they enter “red”, “RED” or
“Red” display the message “I like red too”, otherwise display the message
“I don’t like [colour], I prefer red”.

016
Ask the user if it is raining and convert their answer to lower case
so it doesn’t matter what case they type it in. If they answer “yes”,
ask if it is windy. If they answer “yes” to this second question,
display the answer “It is too windy for an umbrella”, otherwise
display the message “Take an umbrella”. If they did not answer yes
to the first question, display the answer “Enjoy your day”.

017

018

Ask the user’s age. If they
are 18 or over, display the
message “You can vote”, if
they are aged 17, display the
message “You can learn to
drive”, if they are 16, display
the message “You can buy a
lottery ticket”, if they are
under 16, display the
message “You can go Trickor-Treating”.

Ask the user to enter a number. If it is under 10,
display the message “Too low”, if their number is
between 10 and 20, display “Correct”, otherwise
display “Too high”.

019
Ask the user to enter 1, 2 or 3. If they enter a 1, display
the message “Thank you”, if they enter a 2, display
“Well done”, if they enter a 3, display “Correct”. If
they enter anything else, display “Error message”.

Challenges 20 - 26

Strings
Explanation
String is the technical name for text. To define a block of code as a string, you need to
include it in either double quotes (") or single quotes ('). It doesn’t matter which you use so
long as you are consistent.
There are some characters you need to be particularly careful with when inputting them
into strings. These include:

"'\
That is because these symbols have special meanings in Python and it can get confusing if
you use them in a string.
If you want to use one of these symbols you need to
precede it with a backslash symbol and then Python will
know to ignore the symbol and will treat it as normal text
that is to be displayed.

Challenges 20 - 26: Strings

25

Strings and Numbers as
Variables
If you define a variable as a string, even if it only contains numbers, you cannot later use
that string as part of a calculation. If you want to use a variable that has been defined as a
string in a calculation, you will have to convert the string to a number before it can be used.

In this example, the author has asked for a number, but has not defined it as a numeric
value and when the program is run they will get the following error:

Although this error message looks scary, it is simply saying that the line
total = num + 10 isn’t working as the variable num is defined as
a string.
This problem can be solved in one of two ways. You
can either define it as a number when the variable is
being originally created, using this line:

or you can convert it to a number after it has been
created using this line:

26

Challenges 20 - 26: Strings

The same can happen with strings.

In this program, the user is asked to enter their name and a number. They want it joined
together and with strings the addition symbol is used as concatenation. When this
code is run you will get a similar error message to before:

To get around this, either don’t define the variable as a number in the first place or convert
it to a string afterwards using the line:

Multiple-Line Strings
If you want to input a string across multiple lines you can either use the line break (\n) or
you can enclose the entire thing in triple quotes. This will preserve the formatting of the
text.

Challenges 20 - 26: Strings

27

Example Code
Please note: In the following examples, the terms word, phrase, name, firstname and
surname are all variable names.

len(word)

word.upper()

Finds the length of the variable called word.

Changes the string into upper case.

print(word.capitalize())
Displays the variable so only the first word
has a capital letter at the beginning and
everything else is in lower case.

word.lower()
Changes the string into lower case.

word.title()
name = firstname+surname
Joins the first name and surname together
without a space between them, known as
concatenation

Changes a phrase so that every word
has a capital letter at the beginning
with the rest of the letters in the
word in lower case (i.e.Title Case).

text = “ This is some text. ”
print(text.strip(“ ”))
Removes extra characters (in this case spaces) from the start and end of a string.

print (“Hello world”[7:10])
Each letter is assigned an index number to
identify its position in the phrase, including
the space. Python starts counting from 0, not
1.

Therefore, in this example, it would display
the value of positions 7, 8 and 9 ,which is
“orl”.

Pig Latin takes the first consonant of a word,
moves it to the end of the word and adds on an

“way” to the end. For example, pig becomes igpay,
banana becomes ananabay, and aadvark becomes
aadvarkway. Create a program that will ask the
user to enter a word and change it into Pig Latin.
Make sure the new word is displayed in lower case.

Maths
Explanation
Python can perform several mathematical functions, but these are only available when the
data is treated as either an integer (a whole number) or a floating-point (a
number with a decimal place). If data is stored as a string, even if it only contains numeric
characters, Python is unable to perform calculations with it (see page 24 for a fuller
explanation).

Example Code
Please note: In order to use some of the mathematical functions (math.sqrt(num)
and math.pi) you will need to import the maths
print(round(num,2))
library at the start of your program. You do this by
typing import math as the first line of your

Challenges 35 - 44

For Loop
Explanation
A for loop allows Python to keep repeating code a set number of times. It is sometimes
known as a counting loop because you know the number of times the loop will run
before it starts.

In this case, it starts at 1 and will keep repeating the loop
(displaying i) until it reaches 10 and then stops. This is how this
loop would look in Python

In this example, the outputs would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
When it gets to 10 the loop would stop so 10 would
not be shown in the output.

Remember to indent the lines
of code within the for loop.

36

Challenges 35 - 44: For Loop

Example Code
The range function is often used in for loops and lists the starting number, the ending
number and can also include the steps (e.g. counting in 1s, 5s or any other value you wish).

for i in range(1,10):
print(i)
This loop uses a variable called “i” to keep track of the number of times
the loop has been repeated. It will start i at 1 (as that is the starting
value in the range function) and repeat the loop, adding 1 to i each time
and displaying the value of i until it reaches 10 (as dictated by the range
function), where it will stop. Therefore, it will not repeat the loop a tenth
time and will only have the following output:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

for i in range(1,10,2):
print(i)

for i in range(10,1,-3):
print(i)

This range function includes a third value
which shows how much is added to i in
each loop (in this case 2). The output will
therefore be: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

This range will subtract 3 from i each
time. The output will be: 10, 7, 4

Using loops is a
powerful programming
tool that you will use a
lot in the more
challenging programs.

for i in word:
print(i)
This would display each character in a
string called “word” as a separate
output (i.e. on a separate line).

Challenges 45 - 51

While Loop
Explanation
A while loop allows code to be repeated an unknown number of times
as long as a condition is being met. This may be 100 times, just the once or
even never. In a while loop the condition is checked before the code is run,
which means it could skip the loop altogether if the condition is not being
met to start with. It is important, therefore, to make sure the correct
conditions are in place to run the loop before it starts.

In Python the example for the flow chart above would look as follows:

It will keep repeating this code until the user enters anything other than “yes”.

Challenges 45 - 51: While Loop

41

Example Code
total = 0
while total < 100:
num = int(input(“Enter a number: ”))
total = total + num
print(“The total is”, total)
The above program will create a variable called total and store the
value as 0. It will ask the user to enter a number and will add it to
the total. It will keep repeating this as long as the total is still
below 100. When the total equals 100 or more, it will stop running
the loop and display the total.

Set the total to 0 to start with. While the total is 50 or less, ask
the user to input a number. Add that number to the total and
print the message “The total is… [total]”. Stop the loop when
the total is over 50.

Ask the user to enter
a number. Keep
asking until they enter
a value over 5 and
then display the
message “The last
number you entered
was a [number]” and

Challenges 52 - 59

Random
Explanation
Python can generate random values. In reality, the values are not
completely random as no computer can cope with that; instead it uses an
incredibly complex algorithm that makes it virtually impossible to accurately
predict its outcome so, in effect, it acts like a random function.
There are two types of random value that we will be looking at:
x Random numbers within a specified range;
x A random choice from a range of items that are input.
To use these two options, you will need to import the random library. You do
this by typing import random at the start of your program.

46

Challenges 52 - 59: Random

Example Code
import random

num = random.random()

This must appear at
the start of your
program otherwise
the random
function will not
work.

Selects a random floating-point number between 0 and 1 and
stores it in a variable called “num”. If you want to obtain a
larger number, you can multiply it as shown below:

import random
num = random.random()
num = num * 100
print(num)

num = random.randint(0,9)
Selects a random whole number
between 0 and 9 (inclusive).

You
are
doing
great!

num1 = random.randint(0,1000)
num2 = random.randint(0,1000)
newrand = num1/num2
print(newrand)
Creates a random floating-point number by
creating two random integers within two
large ranges (in this case between 0 and
1000) and dividing one by the other.

num = random.randrange(0,100,5)
Picks a random number between the
numbers 0 and 100 (inclusive) in steps of five,
i.e. it will only pick from 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.

colour = random.choice([“red”,“black”,“green”])
Picks a random value from the options “red”, “black” or “green” and stores it as the
variable “colour”. Remember: strings need to include speech marks but numeric data
does not.

Turtle Graphics
Explanation
It is possible to draw using a turtle in Python. By typing in commands
and using loops, you can create intricate patterns. Here is how it works.
A turtle will travel along a path that you define, leaving a pen mark behind it. As you control
the turtle, the pattern that is left is revealed. To draw the pentagon shown below you would
type in the following code.

By combining these simple shapes and using nested loops (i.e. loops inside other loops)
it is possible to create beautiful patterns very easily.

In the above pattern, one pentagon has been repeatedly drawn 10 times, rotating 36
degrees around a central point. Please note: we have highlighted one of the pentagons
to help you identify it within the pattern, but it would not usually be highlighted.

52

Challenges 60 - 68: Turtle Graphics

Example Code
import turtle

scr = turtle.Screen()

This line needs to be included
at the beginning of your

library into Python, allowing
you to use the turtle functions.

Defines the window as being
called “scr”. This means we can
use the shorthand “scr”, rather
than having to refer to the window
by its full name each time.

scr.bgcolor(“yellow”)

turtle.penup()

turtle.pendown()

Sets the screen background
colour to yellow. By default, the
background colour will be
white unless it is changed.

Removes the pen from
the page so that as the
turtle moves it does not
leave a trail behind it.

turtle.pensize(3)

turtle.left(120)

Changes the turtle pen size
(the thickness of the line that is
drawn) to 3. By default, this is 1
unless it is changed.

Turns the turtle 120° to
the left (counter
clockwise).

Places the pen on the
page so that when the
turtle moves it will
leave a trail behind it.
By default, the pen is
down unless specified
otherwise.

turtle.right(90)
Turns the turtle 90° to
the right (clockwise).

turtle.forward(50)
Moves the turtle forward 50
steps.

turtle.shape(“turtle”)
Changes the shape of the turtle to look like a turtle
. By default, the turtle will look like a small arrow.

turtle.hideturtle()
Hides the turtle so it is not
showing on the screen.

turtle.showturtle()
Shows the turtle on the screen.
By default, the turtle is
showing unless specified
otherwise.

turtle.begin_fill()
Entered before the code that draws a shape so it
knows to fill in the shape it is drawing.

turtle.end_fill()
Entered after the code that is drawing the shape to
tell Python to stop filling in the shape.

turtle.color(“black”,“red”)

turtle.exitonclick()

Defines the colours filling in the shape. This
example will make the shape have a black outline
and a red fill. This needs to be entered before the
shape is drawn.

When the user clicks on the
turtle window it will
automatically close.

Challenges 69 - 79: Tuples, Lists and Dictionaries

Challenges 69 - 79

Tuples, Lists and
Dictionaries
Explanation
So far, we have used variables that can store a single item of data in them. When you used
the random.choice([“red”,“blue”,“green”]) line of code you are picking a
random item from a list of possible options. This demonstrates that one item can hold
several pieces of separate data, in this case a collection of colours.
There are several ways that collections of data can be stored as a
single item. Three of the simpler ones are:
x tuples
x lists
x dictionaries

Tuples
Once a tuple is defined you cannot change what is stored in it. This means that when you
write the program you must state what the data is that is being stored in the tuple and the
data cannot be altered while the program is running. Tuples are usually used for menu
items that would not need to be changed.

Lists
The contents of a list can be changed while the program is running and lists are one of
the most common ways to store a collection of data under one variable name in Python. The
data in a list does not all have to be of the same data type. For example, the same list can
store both strings and integers; however, this can cause problems later and is therefore not
recommended.
Please note: In other programming languages the term array is often used
to describe a variable that contains a collection of data, and these work in a similar way to

Challenges 69 - 79: Tuples, Lists and Dictionaries

59

lists in Python. There is a data type called an array in Python, but this is only used to store
numbers and we will look at Python numeric arrays on page 72.

Dictionaries
The contents of a dictionary can also be changed while the program is running. Each
value is given an index or key you can define to help identify each piece of data. This index
will not change if other rows of data are added or deleted, unlike lists where the position of
the items can change and therefore their index number will also change.

Don’t get yourself in a tangle, take each program
and break it into the parts you already know from
previous programs and build in the new skills you
are learning.

60

Challenges 69 - 79: Tuples, Lists and Dictionaries

Example Code
fruit_tuple = (“apple”,“banana”,“strawberry”,“orange”)
Creates a variable name called “fruit_tuple” which stores four pieces of fruit within it. The
round brackets define this group as a tuple and therefore the contents of this collection of
data cannot be altered while the program is running.

print(fruit_tuple.index(“strawberry”))
Displays the index (i.e. the numeric key) of the item “strawberry”. In this example it
will return the number 2 as Python starts counting the items from 0, not 1.

print(fruit_tuple[2])

names_list = [“John”,“Tim”,“Sam”]

Displays item 2 from
“fruit_tuple”, in this case
“strawberry”.

Creates a list of the names and stores them in the
variable “names_list”. The square brackets define
this group of data as a list and therefore the contents
can be altered while the program is running.

del names_list[1]
Deletes item 1 from
“names_list”. Remember
it starts counting from 0
and not 1. In this case it
will delete “Tim” from the
list.

names_list.sort()
Sorts name_list into
alphabetical order and
saves the list in the new
order. This does not work
if the list is storing data of
different types, such as
strings and numeric data
in the same list.

names_list.append(input(“Add a name: “))
Asks the user to enter a name and will add that to the end of
“names_list”.

print(sorted(names_list))
Displays names_list in alphabetical
order but does not change the order of
the original list, which is still saved in
the original order. This does not work
if the list is storing data of different
types, such as strings and numeric
data in the same list.

colours = {1:“red”,2:“blue”,3:“green”}
Creates a dictionary called “colours”, where each item is
assigned an index of your choosing. The first item in each
block is the index, separated by a colon and then the
colour.

colours[2] = “yellow”
Makes a change to the data stored in position 2 of the colours dictionary. In this case it will
change “blue” to “yellow”.

numbers. Please note: as it contains numeric
data, no speech marks are required.

print(x[1:4])
This will display data in positions 1, 2 and 3. In
this case 634, 892 and 345. Remember, Python
starts counting from 0 and will stop when it gets
to the last position, without showing the final
value.

num = int(input(“Enter number: ”))
if num in x:
print(num,“is in the list”)
else:
print(“Not in the list”)
Asks the user to enter a number and checks
whether the number is in the list and displays an
appropriate message.

x.insert(2,420)

x.remove(892)

Inserts the number
420 into position 2 and
pushes everything
else along to make
space. This will

More String
Manipulation
Explanation
A string is the technical name for a group of characters that you do not need to perform
calculations with. “Hello” would be an example of a string, as would “7B”.
Here we have a variable called name which is assigned the value “Simon”.

“Simon” can be thought of as a sequence of individual characters and each character in
that string can be identified by its index.
Index

0

1

2

3

4

Value S i m o n

Note how strings start indexing from 0 and not 1, just as lists do. If the string had a space in
it, the space would also be counted as a character, as would any punctuation in the string.

Now you are familiar with dealing with lists, strings should hold no problems for you as they
use the same methods you have used with lists. However, I have included some additional
code which may prove useful.

Challenges 80 - 87: More String Manipulation

Example Code
Please note: in the examples below, “msg” is a variable name containing a string.

if msg.isupper():
print(“Uppercase”)
else:
print(“This is not in uppercase”)
If the message is in uppercase it will display the message
“Uppercase”, otherwise it will display the message “This
is not in uppercase”.

msg.islower()
Can be used in place of
the isupper () function
to check if the variable
contains lower case
letters.

msg=”Hello”
for letter in msg:
print(letter,end=”*”)
Displays the message, and between each character it will display a “*”.
The output in this example will be: H*e*l*l*o*

Remember, you can always
look back on previous
programs to remind
yourself of the skills learnt
earlier.

Challenges 88 - 95: Numeric Arrays

Challenges 88 - 95

Numeric Arrays
Explanation
Earlier in the book we looked at lists (see page 58). Lists can store a jumble of different types
of data at the same time, including strings and numbers. Python arrays are similar to
lists, but they are only used to store numbers. Numbers can have varying ranges, but
in an array all pieces of data in that array must have the same data type, as outlined
in the table below.
Type code

Common name

Description

Size in bytes

'i'

Integer

Whole number between -32,768 and 32,767

2

'l'

Long

Whole number between -2,147,483,648 and
2,147,483,647

4

'f'

'd'

Allows decimal places with numbers ranging
from -1038 to 1038 (i.e. allows up to 38 numeric
Floating-point
characters including a single decimal point
anywhere in that number and can be negative or
positive value)
Double

Allows decimal places with numbers ranging
from -10308 to 10308

4

8

When you create your array you need to define the type of data it will contain. You cannot
alter or change this while the program is running. Therefore, if you define an array as an 'i'
type (this allows whole numbers between the values −32,768 and 32,767) you cannot add a
decimal point to a number in that array later as it will cause an error message and crash the
program.
Please note: Other programming languages use the term array to
allow the storage of any data type, but in Python arrays only store numbers whereas lists
allow the storage of any data type. If you want to create a variable that stores multiple
strings, in Python you need to create a list rather than an array.

Challenges 88 - 95: Numeric Arrays

73

Example Code
from array import *
This needs to be the first line of your program so that
Python can use the array library.

nums = array (‘i',[45,324,654,45,264])
print(nums)
Creates an array called “nums”. It uses the integer data type and has five items in the
array. It will display the following as the output:

array('i', [45, 324, 654, 45, 264])
for x in nums:
print(x)

newValue = int(input(“Enter number: “))
nums.append(newValue)

Displays the array with
each item appearing on
a separate line.

Asks the user to enter a new number which it will add to
the end of the existing array.

nums.reverse()
Reverses the order of
the array.

nums = sorted(nums)

nums.pop()

Sorts the array into
ascending order.

This will remove the last
item from the array.

newArray = array(‘i’,[])
more = int(input(“How many items: ”))
for y in range(0,more):
newValue=int(input(“Enter num: ”))
newArray.append(newValue)
nums.extend(newArray)
Creates a blank array called “newArray” which uses the
integer data type. It asks the user how many items they
want to add and then appends these new items to
newArray. After all the items have been added it will join
together the contents of newArray and the nums array.

getRid = int(input(“Enter item index: ”))
nums.remove(getRid)
Asks the user to enter the item they want to get rid of and then removes the first item
that matches that value from the array.

print(nums.count(45))
This will display how many times the value “45” appears in the array.

Ask the user to enter numbers. If they enter a
number between 10 and 20, save it in the array,
otherwise display the message “Outside the
range”. Once five numbers have been
successfully added, display the message “Thank
you” and display the array with each item shown
on a separate line.

Create an array which contains
five numbers (two of which
should be repeated). Display
the whole array to the user. Ask
the user to enter one of the
numbers from the array and
then display a message saying
how many times that number
appears in the list.

Keep
going!

092
Create two arrays (one
containing three numbers that
the user enters and one
containing a set of five random
numbers). Join these two arrays
together into one large array.
Sort this large array and display
it so that each number appears
on a separate line.

093
Ask the user to enter five
numbers. Sort them into order
and present them to the user.
Ask them to select one of the
numbers. Remove it from the
original array and save it in a
new array.

Display an array of five
numbers. Ask the user to
select one of the numbers.
Once they have selected a
number, display the
position of that item in the
array. If they enter
something that is not in
the array, ask them to try
again until they select a
relevant item.

Create an array of five numbers
between 10 and 100 which each have
two decimal places. Ask the user to
enter a whole number between 2 and 5.
If they enter something outside of that
range, display a suitable error message
and ask them to try again until they
enter a valid amount. Divide each of the
numbers in the array by the number the
user entered and display the answers
shown to two decimal places.

2D Lists and

Explanation
Technically it is possible to create a two-dimensional array in Python, but as Python arrays
are limited to storing numbers and most Python programmers feel more comfortable with
working with lists, 2D arrays are rarely used and 2D lists are far more common.
Imagine, for one terrifying moment, you are a teacher. Scary I know! Also
imagine you have four students and you teach those same students across
three different subjects. You may, if you are a conscientious teacher, need to
keep records of those students’ grades for each of their subjects. It is possible to create a
simple chart on paper to do this as follows:

Alternatively, if you do not want to use the standard Python column index numbers you can
use a dictionary as follows:

This program will produce the output 37 (the English grade for the pupil with the index
number 0) and can make the data easier to understand.
You can even go further and add a row index as follows:

This will give the output 58, the grade for Peter’s English exam.

Challenges 96 - 103: 2D Lists and Dictionaries

81

Example Code
simple_array = [[2,5,8],[3,7,4],[1,6,9]]
Creates a 2D list (as shown on the right) which uses
standard Python indexing for the rows and columns.

print(simple_array)

print(simple_array[1])

Displays all the data in the 2D
list.

Displays data from row 1, in this case
[3, 7, 4].

simple_array[2][1]= 5

print(simple_array[1][2])

Changes the data in row 2,
column 1 to the value 5.

Displays data from row 1, column 2, in
this case 4.

simple_array[1].append(3)
Adds the value 3 onto the end of the data in
row 1 so in this case it becomes [3, 7, 4, 3].

data_set = {“A”:{“x”:54,“y”:82,“z”:91},“B”:{“x”:75,“y”:29,“z”:80}}
Creates a 2D dictionary using user-defined labels for the rows and columns (as shown
above).

print(data_set[“A”])

print(data_set[“B”][“y”])

Displays data from data set “A”.

Displays data from row “B”, column “y”.

for i in data_set:
print(data_set [i][“y”])

data_set[“B”][“y”] = 53
Changes the data in “B”, “y”, to 53.

Displays the “y” column from each row.

grades[name]={“Maths”:mscore,“English”:escore}
Adds another row of data to a 2D dictionary. In this case, name would be the row index
and Maths and English would be the column indexes.

for name in grades:
print((name),grades[name][“English”])
Displays only the name and the English grade for each
student.

del list[getRid]
Removes a selected
item.

Challenges 105 - 110

Reading and Writing
to a Text File
Explanation
It is all very well being able to define a list, make changes and add new data, but if the next
time the program is run it returns to the original data and your changes are lost then it is
not a lot of use. Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to save data outside of the program
and this way the data can be stored, along with any changes that are made.
The easiest place to start learning about writing and reading from an external
file is with a text file.
When opening an external file you must specify how that file will be used within the
program. The options are below.

Code
w
r
a

Description
Write mode: used to create a new file. Any existing files
with the same name will be erased and a new one
created in its place.
Read mode: used when an existing file is only being
read and not being written to.
Append mode: used to add new data to the end of the
file.

Text files are only used to write, read and append data. By the very nature of how they work
it is not easy to remove or alter individual elements of data once it is written to the file,
unless you want to overwrite the entire file or create a new file to store the new
data. If you want to be able to alter the individual elements once the file has
been created it is better to use a .csv file (see page 91) or an SQL database (see
page 134).

Challenges 105 - 110: Reading and Writing to a Text File

87

Example Code
file = open(“Countries.txt”,“w”)
file.write(“Italy\n”)
file.write(“Germany\n”)
file.write(“Spain\n”)
file.close()
Creates a file called “Countries.txt”. If one already exists then it will be overwritten with
a new blank file. It will add three lines of data to the file (the \n forces a new line after
each entry). It will then close the file, allowing the changes to the text file to be saved.

file = open(“Countries.txt”,“r”)
print(file.read())
This will open the Countries.txt file in “read”
mode and display the entire file.

file = open(“Countries.txt”,“a”)
file.write(“France\n”)
file.close()
This will open the Countries.txt file in “append”
mode, add another line and then close the file.
If the file.close() line is not included, the
changes will not be saved to the text file.

106

Write a new file
called
“Numbers.txt”.
Add five numbers
to the document
which are stored
on the same line
and only
separated by a
comma. Once you
have run the
program, look in
the location where
your program is
stored and you
should see that
the file has been
created. The
easiest way to
view the contents
of the new text file
on a Windows
system is to read it
using Notepad.

Create a new file called “Names.txt”. Add five names to the
document, which are stored on separate lines. Once you have
run the program, look in the location where your program is
stored and check that the file has been created properly.

107

108

Open the
Names.txt
file and
display
the data
in Python.

Open the Names.txt file. Ask the user to input a
new name. Add this to the end of the file and
display the entire file.

110
Using the Names.txt file you
created earlier, display the list of
names in Python. Ask the user to
type in one of the names and then
save all the names except the one
they entered into a new file called
Names2.txt.

109
Display the following menu to the user:

Ask the user to enter 1, 2 or 3. If they select
anything other than 1, 2 or 3 it should display a
suitable error message.
If they select 1, ask the user to enter a school
subject and save it to a new file called
“Subject.txt”. It should overwrite any existing file
with a new file.
If they select 2, display the contents of the
“Subject.txt” file.
If they select 3, ask the user to enter a new
subject and save it to the file and then display
the entire contents of the file.
Run the program several times to test the
options.
Fantastic work, saving data to
external files is an important
programming skill.

Reading and Writing
to a .csv File
Explanation
CSV stands for Comma Separated Values and is a format usually associated with importing
and exporting from spreadsheets and databases. It allows greater control over the data
than a simple text file, as each row is split up into identifiable columns. Below is an
example of data you may want to store.
Name
Brian
Sandra
Zoe
Keith

Age
73
48

A .csv file would store the above data as follows:

However, it may be easier to think of it as being separated into columns and rows that use
an index number to identify them.

Challenges 111 - 117: Reading and Writing to a .csv File

When opening a .csv file to use, you must specify how that file will be used. The options
are:

Description
Creates a new file and writes to that file. If the file

Opens for writing, appending to the end of the file.

Challenges 111 - 117: Reading and Writing to a .csv File

93

Example Code
import csv
This must be at
the top of your
program to allow
Python to use the
.csv library of
commands.

file = open (“Stars.csv”,“w”)
newRecord = “Brian,73,Taurus\n”
file.write(str(newRecord))
file.close()
This will create a new file called “Stars.csv”, overwriting any
previous files of the same name. It will add a new record and
then close and save the changes to the file.

file = open (“Stars.csv”,“a”)
name = input(“Enter name: ”)
age = input(“Enter age: ”)
star = input(“Enter star sign: ”)
newRecord = name + “,” + age + “,” + star + “\n”
file.write(str(newRecord))
file.close()
This will open the Stars.csv file, ask the user to enter the name, age
and star sign, and will append this to the end of the file.

file = open(“Stars.csv”,“r”)
for row in file:
print(row)
This will open the Stars.csv file in read
mode and display the records one row at
a time.

file = open(“Stars.csv”,“r”)
reader = csv.reader(file)
rows = list(reader)
print(rows[1])
This will open the Stars.csv file and
display only row 1. Remember, Python
starts counting from 0.

file = open (“Stars.csv”,“r”)
search = input(“Enter the data you are searching for: ”)
reader = csv.reader(file)
for row in file:
if search in str(row):
print(row)
Asks the user to enter the data they are searching for. It will display all rows that contain
that data anywhere in that row.

94

Challenges 111 - 117: Reading and Writing to a .csv File

import csv
file = list(csv.reader(open(“Stars.csv”)))
tmp = []
for row in file:
tmp.append(row)
A .csv file cannot be altered, only added to. If you need to alter the file you need to
write it to a temporary list. This block of code will read the original .csv file and write it
to a list called “tmp”. This can then be used and altered as a list (see page 58).

file = open(“NewStars.csv”,“w”)

Challenges 118 - 123

Subprograms
Explanation
Subprograms are blocks of code which perform specific
tasks and can be called upon at any time in the program to
run that code.

Advantages
x You can write a block of code and it can be used and reused at different times during the program.
x It makes the program simpler to understand as the code
is grouped together into chunks.

Defining a subprogram and passing variables
between subprograms
Below is a simple program that we would normally create
without subprograms but have written it with subprograms
so you can see how they work:

This program uses three subprograms get_name(), print_Msg() and main().
The get_name() subprogram will ask the user to input their name and then it will return
the value of the variable “user_name” so that it can be used in another subprogram. This is
very important. If you do not return the values, then the values of any variables that were
created or altered in that subprogram cannot be used elsewhere in your program.

100

Challenges 118 - 123: Subprograms

The print_Msg() subprogram will display the message “Hello” and then the user name.
The variable “user_name” appears in the brackets as the current value of the variable is
being imported into the subprogram so it can be used.
The main() subprogram will get the user_name from the get_name() subprogram
(using the variable user_name) as this was returned from the get_name() subprogram. It
will then use that user_name variable in the print_Msg() subprogram.
The last line “main()” is the actual program itself. All this will do is start the main()
subprogram running.
Obviously, there is no need to create such a convoluted way of performing what is in fact a
very simple program, but this is only used as an example of how subprograms are laid out
and variables can be used and passed between the subprograms.
Please note: Python does not like surprises, so if you are going
to use a subprogram in a program, Python must have read the
“def subprogram_name()” line before so it knows where to
go to find it. If you try to refer to a subprogram before Python has
read about it, it panics and will crash. When calling a
subprogram, the subprogram must be written above the section
of code you use to call it. Python will read from the top down and run the first line it comes
across that has not been indented and does not start with the word def. In the program
above this would be main().

Remember: never surprise Python as it
will not like it - good advice for life
generally.

Challenges 118 - 123: Subprograms

101

Example Code
The following examples are all part of the same program and would be displayed in the
order shown here.

def get_data():
user_name = input(“Enter your name: ”)
user_age = int(input(“Enter your age: ”))
data_tuple = (user_name, user_age)
return data_tuple
Defines a subprogram called “get_data()” which will ask the user for their name and
age. As we want to send more than one piece of data back to the main program for other
parts of the program to use, we have combined them together. The return line can only
return a single value, which is why we combined the user_name and user_age variables
into a tuple (see page 58) called data_tuple.

def message(user_name,user_age):
if user_age <= 10:
print(“Hi”, user_name)
else:
print(“Hello”, user_name)
Defines a subprogram called message() which uses two variables that have previously
been defined (user_name and user_age).

def main():
user_name,user_age = get_data()
message(user_name,user_age)
Defines a subprogram called main() which obtains the
two variables from the get_data() subprogram. These
must be labelled in the same order as they were
defined in the tuple. It then calls the message()
subprogram to run with the two variables.

main()
Runs the main() subprogram.

119

Define a subprogram that will ask the user to
enter a number and save it as the variable
“num”. Define another subprogram that will
use “num” and count from 1 to that number.

Define a subprogram
that will ask the user to
pick a low and a high
number, and then
generate a random
number between those
two values and store it in
a variable called
“comp_num”.

120
Display the following menu to the user:

If they enter a 1, it should run a subprogram that will
generate two random numbers between 5 and 20, and
ask the user to add them together. Work out the correct
answer and return both the user’s answer and the
correct answer.
If they entered 2 as their selection on the menu, it
should run a subprogram that will generate one number
between 25 and 50 and another number between 1 and
25 and ask them to work out num1 minus num2. This
way they will not have to worry about negative answers.
Return both the user’s answer and the correct answer.
Create another subprogram that will check if the user’s
answer matches the actual answer. If it does, display
“Correct”, otherwise display a message that will say
“Incorrect, the answer is” and display the real answer.
If they do not select a relevant option on the first menu
you should display a suitable message.

Define another
subprogram that will
give the instruction “I am
thinking of a number…”
and then ask the user to
guess the number they
are thinking of.
Define a third
subprogram that will
check to see if the
comp_num is the same
as the user’s guess. If it
is, it should display the
message “Correct, you
win”, otherwise it should
keep looping, telling the
user if they are too low or
too high and asking them
to guess again until they
guess correctly.

121
Create a program that will allow the user to easily manage a list of names. You should
display a menu that will allow them to add a name to the list, change a name in the
list, delete a name from the list or view all the names in the list. There should also be a
menu option to allow the user to end the program. If they select an option that is not
relevant, then it should display a suitable message. After they have made a selection
to either add a name, change a name, delete a name or view all the names, they
should see the menu again without having to restart the program. The program
should be made as easy to use as possible.

103

Including menus
helps make the
program easier to

Create the following menu:

If the user selects 1, allow them to add to a file
called Salaries.csv which will store their name
and salary. If they select 2 it should display all
records in the Salaries.csv file. If they select 3 it
should stop the program. If they select an
incorrect option they should see an error
message. They should keep returning to the
menu until they select option 3.

123
In Python, it is not technically possible to directly
delete a record from a .csv file. Instead you need
to save the file to a temporary list in Python,
make the changes to the list and then overwrite
the original file with the temporary list.
Change the previous program to allow you to do
this. Your menu should now look like this:

Tkinter GUI
Graphical User Interface
Explanation
A GUI (graphical user interface) makes the program easier to use. It allows you, as the
programmer, to create screens, text boxes and buttons to help the user navigate through
the program in a more user-friendly way. Tkinter is a library of features in Python that
allows you to do this.
Look at the code below and in particular the measurements that are used in the
window.geometry and button.place lines.

Now look at the window that this code will produce:

The geometry line in the code determines the size of the window and the place line in
the code determines the position of the individual item on the window.

Challenges 124 - 132: Tkinter GUI

111

Once the button is pressed it will run the “Call” subprogram and change the window to look
as follows:

112

Challenges 124 - 132: Tkinter GUI

Example Code
from tkinter import *
This line must go at the beginning of the program to import the Tkinter library.

window = Tk()
window.title(“Window Title”)
window.geometry(“450x100”)
Creates a window that will act as the
display, referred to as “window”, adds a title
and defines the size of the window.

label = Label(text = “Enter number:”)
Adds text to the screen displaying the message
shown.

entry_box = Entry (text = 0)
Creates a blank entry box. Entry boxes can be used by
the user to input data or used to display output.

output_box = Message(text = 0)
Creates a message box which is used to display an
output.

output_box [“bg”] = “red”

output_box [“fg”] = “white”

Specifies the background colour of the
object.

Specifies the font colour of the object.

output_box [“relief”] = “sunken”

list_box = Listbox()

Specifies the style of the box. This can be flat,
raised, sunken, grooved and ridged.

Creates a drop-down list box
which can only contain strings.

entry_box [“justify”] = “center”
Specifies the justification of the text in an entry box,
but this does not work for message boxes.

button1 = Button(text = “Click here”, command = click)
Creates a button that will run the subprogram “click”.

Challenges 124 - 132: Tkinter GUI

113

label.place(x = 50, y = 20, width = 100, height = 25)
Specifies the position in which the object will appear in the window. If the position is
not specified the item will not appear in the window.

entry_box.delete(0, END)
Deletes the contents of an entry or
list box.

num = entry_box.get()
Saves the contents of an entry box and stores it
in a variable called num. This does not work
with message boxes.

answer = output_txt[“text”]
Obtains the contents of a message box and
stores it in a variable called answer. This does
not work with an entry box.

output_txt[“text”] = total
Changes the content of a message box to
display the value of the variable total.

window.mainloop()
This must be at the end of the program to make
sure it keeps working.

Every challenge you
complete helps you
become a better
programmer.

Create a window that will
ask the user to enter their
name. When they click on
a button it should display
the message “Hello” and
their name and change
the background colour
and font colour of the
message box.

Write a program that
can be used instead
of rolling a six-sided
die in a board game.
When the user clicks
a button it should
display a random
whole number
between 1 to 6
(inclusive).

Create a program that will ask
the user to enter a number in a
box. When they click on a
button it will add that number
to a total and display it in
another box. This can be
repeated as many times as
they want and keep adding to
the total. There should be
another button that resets the
total back to 0 and empties the
original text box, ready for
them to start again.

127
Create a window that will ask the user to enter a
name in a text box. When they click on a button it
will add it to the end of the list that is displayed on
the screen. Create another button which will clear
the list.

129
Create a window that will ask the
user to enter a number in a text box.
When they click on a button it will
use the code
variable.isdigit() to check
to see if it is a whole number. If it is
a whole number, add it to a list box,
otherwise clear the entry box. Add
another button that will clear the
list.

128
1 kilometre = 0.6214 miles and 1
mile = 1.6093 kilometres. Using
these figures, make a program
that will allow the user to
convert between miles and
kilometres.

130
Alter program 129 to add a third button that
will save the list to a .csv file. The code

tmp_list = num_list.get(0,END)
can be used to save the contents of a list box
as a tuple called tmp_list.

131

132

Create a program that will allow the
user to create a new .csv file. It should
ask them to enter the name and age of
a person and then allow them to add
this to the end of the file they have
just created.

Using the .csv file you created for the last
challenge, create a program that will allow
people to add names and ages to the list
and create a button that will display the
contents of the .csv file by importing it to a
list box.

three names; “Bob”, “Sue” and “Tim” to the user;
x added a second image in the lower half of the window which will
change to show the photograph of the person selected from the
drop-down list when the user clicks on the Click Me button.

Challenges 133 - 138: More Tkinter

125

All the code to create this window can be created using the code we looked at in the
previous section and the example code you will be looking at in this chapter.
When using images in your program, it is easier if they are stored in the same folder as the
program. Otherwise you need to include the entire dictionary location of the file as follows:

If you store the image in the same folder as the program you only need to include the file
name as shown below:

Please note: it is only possible to use GIF or PGM/PPM file types for images in Tkinter as
other file types are not supported. Make sure your images are saved in a suitable format
and with a suitable name in the correct location before you start creating the programs, if at
all possible, to make your life simpler.

126

Challenges 133 - 138: More Tkinter

Example Code
window.wm_iconbitmap(“MyIcon.ico”)
Changes the icon displayed in the title of the window.

window.configure(background = “light green”)
Changes the background colour of the window, in this case to light green.

logo = PhotoImage(file = “logo.gif”)
logoimage = Label(image = logo)
logoimage.place(x = 30, y = 20, width = 200, height = 120)
Displays an image in a label widget. This image will not change while the program is
running.

photo = PhotoImage(file = “logo.gif”)
photobox = Label(window, image = photo)
photobox.image = photo
photobox.place(x = 30, y = 20, width = 200, height = 120)
This is similar to the block above but as we want the image to change as we update the
data we need to add the code photobox.image = photo, which makes it
updatable.

selectName = StringVar(window)
selectName.set(“Select Name”)
namesList = OptionMenu(window,selectName,“Bob”,“Sue”,“Tim”)
namesList.place(x = 30, y = 250)
Creates a variable called selectName which will store a string where the original
value of the variable is “Select Name”. It will then create a drop-down option menu
which stores the value the user selects in the selectName variable and displays the
values in the list: Bob, Sue and Tim.

Challenges 133 - 138: More Tkinter

127

def clicked():
sel = selectName.get()
mesg = “Hello “ + sel
mlabel[“text”] = mesg
if sel == “Bob”:
photo = PhotoImage(file = “Bob.gif”)
photobox.image = photo
elif sel == “Sue”:
photo = PhotoImage(file = “Sue.gif”)
photobox.image = photo
elif sel == “Tim”:
photo = PhotoImage(file = “Tim.gif”)
photobox.image = photo
else:
photo = PhotoImage(file = “logo.gif”)
photobox.image = photo
photobox[“image”] = photo
photobox.update()
In this example, when a button is clicked it will run the “clicked” subprogram. This will
obtain the value from the selectName variable and create a message that will be
displayed in a label. It will then check to see which option has been selected and
change the picture to the correct image, which is displayed in the photo variable. If no
name is selected it will simply show the logo.

Don’t forget, if you
get stuck, look at
some of your earlier
programs, they may
help you.

Challenges 139 - 145

SQLite
Explanation
SQL stands for “Structured Query Language” and is the main language that the large
database packages use. SQLite is free software that can be used as an SQL database. You
can download the latest version of the software from www.sqlite.org.

From the download page you need to select one of the “Precompiled Binaries” options for
either Mac OS or Windows that includes the “command-line-shell”.

To use SQL you need to load the “DB Browser for SQLite” which you can download from
https://sqlitebrowser.org.

Challenges 139 - 145: SQLite

135

Understanding a Relational
Database
We will use the example of a small manufacturing company that stores the details of their
employees in an SQL database.
Below is an example of the Employees table, which contains the details of all the employees
in the company. The contents of a table can be viewed by clicking on the Browse Data tab.

It has four fields (ID, Name, Dept and Salary) and 10
records in it (one for each employee). Take a look at
the employees list and you will notice that more
than one employee is listed in the same department.
In most databases you would find repetitive data
such as this. To make the database work more
efficiently the repeated data are often stored in a
separate table. In this case there is a department
table which would store all the information about
each department to save having to repeat all the
department details for each employee.

136

Challenges 139 - 145: SQLite

Here we can see the Departments table holding the details about each department. We
have simplified it and only include one piece of data for each department (in this case the
manager’s name) but it will still save having to input the manager’s name on every record,
which we would have to do if the data were all being saved in one large table.
By splitting the data into two tables like this, if we need to update the manager it only needs
to be updated in one place rather than updating it several times, which we would need to
do if it was all stored in a single table.
This is known as a one-to-many relationship as one department can have many
employees in it.
A primary key is the field (usually the first one) in each table that
stores the unique identifier for that record. Therefore, in the Employees
table the primary key will be the ID column and in the Department table
the primary key will be Dept.
When creating a table, you need to identify the following for each field:
x the name of the field (field names cannot contain spaces and must follow the same
rules as variable names);
x if it is a primary key;
x the data type for that field.
The data types you can use are as follows:
x integer: the value is an integer value;
x real: the value is a floating-point value;
x text: the value is a text string;
x blob: the value is stored exactly as it was input.
You can also specify if the field cannot be left blank by adding NOT NULL to the end of the
field when you create it.

Example Code
import sqlite3
This must be the first
line of the program to

folder as the program.

cursor.execute(“““CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees(
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
name text NOT NULL,
dept text NOT NULL,
salary integer);”””)
Creates a table called employees which has four fields (id, name, dept and salary). It
specifies the data type for each field, defines which field is the primary key and which
fields cannot be left blank. The triple speech marks allow the code to be split over
several lines to make it easier to read rather than having it all displayed in one line.

cursor.execute(“““INSERT INTO employees(id,name,dept,salary)
VALUES(“1”,”Bob”,”Sales”,”25000”)”””)

Challenge Introduction to Part II

149

Introduction to Part II
In this section, you are given some large programming challenges to work through.
These will take longer than the previous challenges and you are likely to have to
refer to earlier sections of the book to remind yourself of some of the key skills you
have covered. Don’t feel bad if you need to look up key lines of code in previous
sections; even experienced programmers get help when they come across a tricky piece of
code with which they are not familiar. It is all part of the learning process and is exactly how
this book was written to be used.
Each challenge contains a list of the skills that will be
needed so you can decide if you feel ready to attempt
the challenge. It also includes a description of the
challenge and a section outlining problems you will
have to overcome. The solutions in this section are
much larger and some are split over several pages, but
should be read as a continuous single program for that
challenge. If a program does need to be split across
separate pages we try to split it between the
subprograms or in a natural break if possible.
Read each challenge all the way through before
attempting it so you are aware of the pitfalls. Once you
have read through the challenge, sit back and have a
think about how you are going to approach it. You may
want to scribble some notes, or if you are feeling very
keen and know how, you may even venture into writing
a flow chart. There is no point in diving straight into
tapping out lines of code with no idea where you are
heading, as you are likely to get into a muddle and may
lose faith in your abilities. Make a plan, split the large
problem into small, manageable chunks, and then
tackle each chunk, testing each section as you go. Now,
make yourself a drink, grab a notebook and pencil, take
a deep breath, turn the page and have a go at the first
one.

150

Challenge 146: Shift Code

146: Shift Code
In this challenge you will need to use the following skills:
x input and display data;
x lists;
x splitting and joining strings;
x if statements;
x loops (while and for);
x subprograms.

The Challenge
A shift code is where a message can be easily encoded and is one of the simplest codes to
use. Each letter is moved forwards through the alphabet a set number of letters to be
represented by a new letter. For instance, “abc” becomes “bcd” when the code is shifted by
one (i.e. each letter in the alphabet is moved forward one character).
You need to create a program which will display the following menu:

If the user selects 1, they should be able to type in a message (including spaces) and then
enter a number. Python should then display the encoded message once the shift code has
been applied.
If the user selects 2, they should enter an encoded message and the
correct number and it should display the decoded message (i.e.
move the correct number of letters backwards through the
alphabet).
If they select 3 it should stop the program from running.
After they have encoded or decoded a message the menu should be
displayed to them again until they select quit.

Challenge 146: Shift Code

151

Problems You Will Have to
Overcome
Decide if you want to allow both upper and lower case letters or if you want to convert all
the data into one case.
Decide if you are allowing punctuation.
If the shift makes the letter go past the end of the alphabet it should start again; i.e. if the
user enters “xyz” and 5 is entered as the shift number, it should display “bcd”. This should
work the opposite way for decoding a message, so if the value gets to “a” it will go back to
“w”.
Make sure that suitable messages are displayed if the user selects an inappropriate option
on the menu or selects an inappropriate number to make the shift code.
Test out your decode option by decoding the message “we
ovugjohsslunl”, which was created with the number 7 when
the code only uses “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ” (note the
space at the end).

Challenge 147: Mastermind

153

147: Mastermind
In this challenge you will need to use the following skills:
x input and display data;
x lists;
x random choice from a list;
x if statements;
x loops (while and for);
x subprograms.

The Challenge
You are going to make an on-screen version of the board game “Mastermind”. The
computer will automatically generate four colours from a list of possible colours (it should
be possible for the computer to randomly select the same colour more than once). For
instance, the computer may choose “red”, “blue”, “red”, “green”. This sequence should not
be displayed to the user.
After this is done the user should enter their choice of four colours from the same list the
computer used. For instance, they may choose “pink”, “blue”, “yellow” and “red”.
After the user has made their selection, the program should display how many colours they
got right in the correct position and how many colours they got right but in the wrong
position. In the example above, it should display the message “Correct colour in the correct
place: 1” and “Correct colour but in the wrong place: 1”.
The user continues guessing until they correctly enter the four colours in the order they
should be in. At the end of the game it should display a suitable message and tell them how
many guesses they took.

154

Challenge 147: Mastermind

Problems You Will Have to
Overcome
The hardest part of this game is working out the logic for checking how many the user has
correct and how many are in the wrong place. Using the example above, if the user enters
“blue”, “blue”, “blue”, “blue” they should see the messages, “Correct colour in the correct
place: 1” and “Correct colour but in the wrong place: 0”.
Decide if there is an easier way of allowing the user to enter their selection (e.g. using a
code or a single letter to represent the colour). If using the first letter, make sure you only
use colours that have a unique first letter (i.e. avoid using blue, black and brown as options
and select just one of these as a possibility). Make your instructions clear to the user.
Decide if you want to allow upper and lower case or if it is easier to convert everything to
the same case.
Make sure you build in validation checks to make sure the user is
only entering valid data and display a suitable message if they make
an incorrect selection. If they do make an incorrect selection you
may want to allow them to enter the data again, rather than class it
as an incorrect guess.

Challenge 148: Passwords

148: Passwords
In this challenge you will need to use the following skills:
x input and display data;
x lists;
x if statements;
x loops (while and for);
x subprograms;
x saving to and reading from a .csv file.

The Challenge
You need to create a program that will store the user ID and passwords for the users of a
system. It should display the following menu:

If the user selects 1, it should ask them to enter a user ID. It should check if the user ID is
already in the list. If it is, the program should display a suitable message and ask them to
select another user ID. Once a suitable user ID has been entered it should ask for a
password. Passwords should be scored with 1 point for each of the following:
x it should have at least 8 characters;
x it should include uppercase letters;
x it should include lower case letters;
x it should include numbers; and
x it should include at least one special character such as !, £, $, %, &, <, * or @.
If the password scores only 1 or 2 it should be rejected with a message saying it is a weak
password; if it scores 3 or 4 tell them that “This password could be improved.” Ask them if

Challenge 148: Passwords

157

they want to try again. If it scores 5 tell them they have selected a strong password. Only
acceptable user IDs and passwords should be added to the end of the .csv file.
If they select 2 from the menu they will need to enter a user ID, check to see if the user ID
exists in the list, and if it does, allow the user to change the password and save the changes
to the .csv file. Make sure the program only alters the existing password and does not
create a new record.
If the user selects 3 from the menu, display all the user IDs but not the
passwords.
If the user selects 4 from the menu it should stop the program.

Problems You Will Have to
Overcome
As existing data in .csv files cannot be edited and can only be read or added to, you will
need to import the data as a temporary list into Python so you can make the changes before
the data is written to the .csv file afresh.
Make sure only passwords belonging to an existing user ID can be altered.
Use suitable messages to guide the user easily through the system.
Repeat the menu until they quit the program.

158

Challenge 148: Passwords

Answer
For this challenge you will need to set up a .csv file first, called “passwords.csv”. You can
either use code to do this or simply create an Excel file and save it as a .csv file. It needs to
be stored in the same location as the file.

What Next?
If you have worked through all the examples in this book you should have a good
understanding of the basics of programming with Python. You will have become familiar
with the syntax of the language and started to think like a programmer by breaking down
larger problems into small, manageable chunks you know how to solve. You should look
back on all you have learnt and can justifiably feel a smirk of satisfaction at what you have
achieved. Learning to program takes dedication and you have shown you can persevere,
and you now have the basic skills to continue on your journey into Python.
The skills you have learnt in this book will allow you to create powerful programs, but now
is not the time to sit back and relax. You need to go out into the big programming world and
find out how other programmers work. Search the internet, find new challenges. As you
explore you will see code that is unfamiliar to you as there are several variations that can be
used. For instance, with Tkinter there is another method called “pack” which many
programmers prefer. It allows you to use a grid method for designing your screens but does
not allow you to fine-tune the position of an object the way the place method we have been
using allows. Try it out, you may prefer it, but do be careful as some techniques do not work
well with others. If you want to use the pack method then please don’t try to mix it with the
place method in the same program. Python doesn’t like working with two different systems
simultaneously and will crash.
The best way to learn more advanced programming techniques is to try them
out. Look at other people’s code and visit some chat forums. Programmers are
very helpful and as long as you are not asking a
question that has already been answered on the forum
they are generally willing to help you out. If you are stuck
on a piece of code, then ask for help in a forum;
programmers like nothing more than to solve a problem.
You may not necessarily agree with their solution, it may
not be the method you are looking to use, but it will give
you an idea of how to look at it with fresh eyes and can
show you a route to a possible solution you had not
considered before.
Whether you feel satisfied with your knowledge or want to
explore further, I hope you have enjoyed your venture into
programming and this book has proved useful.

To use the random library in Python you must have the line “import
random” at the start of your program. See also randint, choice,
random and randrange.

randrange

Picks a number from within a range of numbers. It is possible to even
select the steps that range can take, for instance:
This will pick a random number between the numbers 0 and 100 in
steps of 5, e.g. it will only pick from 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.

Term
range

177

Description
Used to define a starting and end number in a range and can include
the step (the difference between each number in the sequence).
Usually used as part of a for loop.
Would produce the output:

read a file

real
record

remainder

Opens an existing text or .csv file so the data can be read.
See also write to a file, write to non-existing file, append to a file
A data type used in SQL databases that can store a decimal place.
See floating-point number, SQL and database.
In a database a record is one complete set of fields; for example one
employee’s set of data would be stored in a single row of a table. See
SQL, database, table and field.
Finds the remainder after a whole number division.

remove

Deletes an item from the list. This is useful if you do not know the
index of that item. If there is more than one instance of the data it will
only delete the first instance of that data.

reverse

Reverses the order of a list, tuple, dictionary, string or an array.

right

Turns the turtle clockwise.

round

In the above example it will turn 90°.
Rounds a variable to a specified number of decimal places.

round brackets

Defines the values inside the brackets as a tuple. See tuple.

run time error

These errors only crop up when you try to run the program. For
instance, it may not be able to work with a variable as it is saved as a
string when it is expecting an integer. Run time errors will crash the
program and display an error message such as the following.

running a
program
shell

Select the Run menu and select Run Module, alternatively use the F5
key. The program must be saved before it can run.
The first screen you see when you launch Python.

Term

sort

Description
Sorts a list into alphabetical order and saves the list in the new order.
This does not work if the list is storing data of different types, such as
strings and numeric data in the same list.

sorted

Prints a list in alphabetical order. This does not alter the order of the
original list and it is still kept in the original order. This does not work
if the list is storing data of different types, such as strings and
numeric data in the same list.

space (removal)
speech marks

See strip.
Used to define a block of code as a string. You can use either double
quotes (") or single quotes (') but whatever you use to start your
string you must use the same style to define the end of the string.
You can use triple speech marks to preserve the formatting such as
line breaks.

SQL

SQLite
sqrt

Stands for Structured Query Language, which is used to
communicate with a database. A database can contain several tables
joined together, which is known as a relation database. Each table is
made up of fields that contain similar data such as ID, Name,
Address, etc. Each row in the table is known as a record. See
database, field, record, table and query.
A simple database that is free to download and works well with
Python.
Works out the square root of a number. You need to import the math
library at the start of your program for this to work.

square brackets

Defines the values inside the brackets as a list. See list.

square root
str

See sqrt.
A data type as string. See string.

string

Can include letters, numbers and various symbols and be enclosed
by either double or single quotes. They cannot be used in a
calculation, even if they only contain numbers. They can, however,
be used in concatenation and joined onto other strings to make a
larger string. See concatenation.
Removes additional characters from the start and end of a string.

Term
subprogram

Description
A block of code that can be called to run from another section of the
program and can return a value.

subtraction

Subtracts one value from another.

syntax error

A programming error that occurs when statements are in the wrong
order or contain typographical errors.
A container for the data. A database may contain more than one
table and these can be linked together. Below is an example of a
table to store employees’ data.

table

See SQL, database, field and record.

Term
text file

Description
A file object that is imported into Python and allows the program to
read and write string objects to that file.

text file
title

See also write to a text file, read a text file and append to a text file.
Changes the case so all words start with a capital and the rest are in
lower case.

Tkinter
to the power of
trim spaces
tuple

Tkinter is Python's most commonly used GUI library.
See indices.
See strip.
A type of list but the values cannot be altered as the program is
running. Usually reserved for menu options that are unlikely to
change.

turtle

A tool used for drawing shapes on the screen.

two-dimensional
list
upper

See also forward, left, right, penup, pendown and pensize.
See 2D list.
Changes a string to uppercase.

variables

Stores values such as text and numbers. The equal sign (=) is used
to assign values to variables.

while loop

A type of loop that will repeat the block of code inside it (shown with
indented rows) as long as a particular condition is being met.

whole number
division

The process by which you find how many times a number (divisor) is
contained in another number (dividend).

window

The screen used in a GUI. The code below creates a window,
referred to as “window”, adds a title and defines the size of the
window.

See Tkinter.

Term
write to a file

write to nonexisting file

181

Description
Creates a new text or .csv file to save values into; if one already exists
then it will be overwritten with a new file.

See also write to non-existing file, append to a file, read a file.
Creates a new file and writes to that file. If the file already exists, the
program will crash rather than overwrite it.

See also write to a file, append to a file, read a file.
